As well as moving house, Arnett, 52, had a baby over lockdown, Alexander, known as Denny, with his girlfriend Alessandra Brawn. He also has two older sons with his ex-wife, Amy Poehler. How has having his third baby in his 50s compared with having his first in his 30s? “Well, when you already have kids, you know how long the road is. Like, this morning, just getting my two older boys out of the house and to school took a couple hours and by the time I’m home it’s 8.30 and I’m three hours into the day already and I’m like: ‘Oh my god. I’m in this for A WHILE,’” he says, rubbing his eyes. Arnett looks far better than anyone with a 20-month-old baby has any right to, but his handsome appearance always did undercut his loser persona (or maybe that should be the other way around). So he’s not planning the fourth and fifth babies? He fixes his face into an exaggerated grin with wide-open, terrified eyes. “No. I am absolutely not doing that.”
